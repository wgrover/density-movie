I created this animation to accompany [our *PNAS* paper about measuring the density of single cells](http://wgrover.com/research/2011/06/20/cell-density.html).  Several people have asked me how I made the animation, so here is the [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) source code.

More details on how I made this are available [on my website](http://wgrover.com/graphics/).
